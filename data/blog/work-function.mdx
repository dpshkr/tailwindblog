# Introduction

Standard semiconductor physics textbooks define work function somewhat vaguely, 
which only brings out part of the physical significance of the term.

> Work function is the difference between the Fermi level $E_F$ and the vacuum level $E_0$,
> where the vacuum level is the energy state of electrons outside the material.

While technically correct, the definition of the vacuum level of the material requires more elaboration.
